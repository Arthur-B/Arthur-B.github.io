Phd student in nanotechnology, I use numerical optimisation technics such as Machine Learning to develop new metamaterials. I mainly study color filters, trying to unravel the link between the color transmitted by the material and the structure printed at the nanoscale.

## Experience ##

#### PhD ####

#### Internship: Plasmonic color filters ####

For my graduating internship I came back to the Advanced Photonic Materials laboratory at KAIST. My subject was a direct follow-up from my previous internship, the study of plasmonic color filters. Machine Learning techniques were used to unravel the link between the transmitted color and the structure printed at the nanoscale.

#### Internship: Building from the ground up a simulation code ####

For my graduating internship I came back to the Advanced Photonic Materials laboratory at KAIST. My subject was a direct follow-up from my previous internship, the study of plasmonic color filters. Machine Learning techniques were used to unravel the link between the transmitted color and the structure printed at the nanoscale.

#### Internship: Plasmonic color filters ####

For the summer I worked at the Advanced Photonic Materials and Devices laboratory at KAIST, supervised by Professor Jonghwa Shin. I worked on plasmonic color filters. I studied nanoholes arrays using FDTD simulations. My goal was to determine the influence of parameters such as the the period, the diameter or the depth of the holes.

I was able to tune the structure in order to transmit a specific wavelength with a specific transmission coefficient, achieving a color palette.

#### Internship: Designing nanostructures for non linear optics ####

I did numerical computations in Python, based on an in-house simulation code, to study an optical Helmholtz resonator. I tuned the different geometrical parameters of the structure (size, period of the arrays, ...) to optimize the second harmonic generation.
